## Maze Generator and Solver

This is a Python-based project that generates and solves mazes using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the `Tkinter` library.

## Features
- **Maze Generation**: Implements a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate perfect mazes.
- **Maze Solving**: Uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.
- **Visualization**: Animates both the maze generation and solving processes.

## How It Works
1. **Maze Generation**:
   - Uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to carve paths within a grid, ensuring there are no loops.
2. **Maze Solving**:
   - Utilizes the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
3. **Visualization**:
   - The maze generation and solution are displayed in real-time with graphical animations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Maze-Generator-and-Solver
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   - Python 3.x
   - Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Usage
Run the script to generate and solve a maze:
```bash
python maze_generator_solver.py
```
